This app is meant to take the JSON results that are generated by the steps [outlined here](https://github.com/whitelotusapps/zendesk-developer-user-group/wiki/2023-06-23-Zendesk-Developer-User-Group-Developer-Tools-Pagination-in-Postman).

## Prerequisites

- Streamlit needs to be installed

If you do not have Streamlit installed, you can install it by executing the below command:

```
pip install streamlit
```

If you are using VS Code, you can open a new Terminal window and copy and paste the above to install Streamlit.
## Usage

Assumptions:
- You are using VS Code
- Streamlit has been installed

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Open a new Terminal window and navigate to the folder where this repo has been cloned to
3. Once you are in the folder of this repo, type in: ```streamlit run app.py```
4. This should load the app, and it should even open up your default web browser and navigate you to a an address similar to: ```http://localhost:8501/```
5. In your Terminal window, you should see output that resembles something similar to the below:

    ```
    PS F:\postman_json_to_csv> streamlit run app.py

    You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

    Local URL: http://localhost:8501
    Network URL: http://192.168.1.249:8501
    ```
6. When you arrive to the main page of the application, it will look like this.

    - The option for File will allow you to browse and select a JSON file to load. You would select this option if you opted to paste the results from Postman and save them into a .json file.
    - The option for Text will allow you to paste the results that you copied from Postman directly into the app
      - If you paste in the results, you will need to press the Tab button after pasting in the data

7. You will then be shown all of the keys, in alphabetical order, that are available to export

8. Remove and/or rearrange the order of the keys as you see fit

9. Once you have selected and arranged the keys that you wish to have exported, press the Export to CSV button. You should receive a message about the export being successful, and be shown the file name of the export.

10. In the same folder, you will now have a CSV file that starts off with "JSONtoCSV_" and then has a time stamp.
